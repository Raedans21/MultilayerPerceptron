# Multilayer Perceptron Project #

## MLP Implementation ##
The implementation of the multilayer perceptron 
can be found in the mlp.py file.

## UCI MPG Regression Dataset ##
The train_mpg.py file downloads the UCI MPG regression dataset, formats the data, and trains a three layer MLP 
on that data.

## MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset ##
The train_mpg.py file processes the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, format the data, and trains a five layer MLP.
Note: the data files are not included here, but can be downloaded from Kaggle and added to the repo directory at this link:
